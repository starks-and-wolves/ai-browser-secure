# Backend API URL for production deployment
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update this with your actual backend URL!
#
# For Replit:
# Format: https://YOUR-BACKEND-REPL-NAME.YOUR-USERNAME.repl.co
# Example: https://browser-use-backend.johndoe.repl.co
#
# Leave this commented out to auto-detect (works on Replit)
# or set explicitly:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://browser-use-backend.YOUR_USERNAME.repl.co
#
# For Render/other platforms, set your backend URL here
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
#
# For Replit deployment, you can also set this as a Replit Secret (🔒)
# and it will override this file
